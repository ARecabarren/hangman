## Hangman Game

Welcome to the Hangman game project! This project is a simple command-line game where one player plays against the computer. The goal of the game is to correctly guess the secret word before the player runs out of guesses.

### How to Play

To play the game, simply download the dictionary file google-10000-english-no-swears.txt and run the following commands in your terminal:

ruby hangman.rb

This will start a new game where the player can make guesses and try to win. The game will keep track of the number of correct and incorrect guesses, and the player can save the game at any time by typing "save". To try the game, please follow the link to the GitHub repository and download the files.
